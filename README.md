Sophia Architecture: Process Mining Automation Framework for Open Government Data

The uploaded .puml files correspond to the diagrams of the Sophia architecture, an initial proposal developed during the doctoral research to support the future automation of preprocessing and analysis of Open Government Data (OGD) in process mining.
The Sophia architecture was designed to consolidate the necessary knowledge for identifying and mapping key attributes (caseid, activity, timestamp) and transforming tabular data into event logs.
Based on the methods proposed in the thesis and architectural patterns described in the literature, the diagrams were created using PlantUML, following the C4 model, to ensure clarity and effective communication of system components and flows.
The diagrams represent different levels of system abstraction (context, containers, components) and were iteratively refined alongside the research progress.
These diagrams are part of the technological contributions of the research, serving as a conceptual foundation for the future development of algorithms and systems aimed at automating manual tasks, minimizing errors, and optimizing the preprocessing and analysis phases in process mining applied to OGD.
